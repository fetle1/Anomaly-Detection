# Anomaly-Detection
Anomaly detection is a crucial component of data quality assurance in healthcare systems, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where digital health infrastructure is often underdeveloped, fragmented, or manually maintained.
 Anomalies in health data — such as missing values, outliers, and contextual inconsistencies — can significantly compromise the reliability of clinical decision-making, public health research, and health policy planning.
